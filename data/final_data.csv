0,Atlanta Hawks,1,1,2,-2,-2,-1,1,-1,red,grey,A team that you can depend on to at least finish in the middle of the standings almost every year. Life as a Hawks fan is just consistent — rarely the most exciting experience but rarely humiliating.
1,Boston Celtics,2,2,-2,1,-1,2,2,-2,green,gold,"The most prolific winner in league history, it’s almost annoying how the Celtics are good ALL the time. But not nearly as annoying as Boston sports fans."
2,Brooklyn Nets,1,-2,-1,2,1,-2,-1,-1,black,grey,"Meet the Brooklyn Nets, the hipster younger sibling of the New York Knicks. They’re the more well-managed franchise of the two New York teams and have been better over the last decade, which is why they have more international fans than the Knicks despite not having much of a following locally."
3,Charlotte Hornets,-1,1,2,-2,1,-1,1,2,teal,blue,"Michael Jordan used to own this team - up until he sold it just over a month ago. So yeah, not exactly an easy team to commit yourself to. In fact, if Michael Jordan is associated with a team in any way and said team is not named the Chicago Bulls, that’s bad news. I would just start over if I were you."
4,Chicago Bulls,2,2,-2,2,2,1,2,-1,red,black,Michael Jordan. Six championships. Need I say more? Some side effects of being a Bulls fan might include extreme feelings of 90s nostalgia - even if you were born in the 00s - as well as general distrust in modern medicine after watching your best players get injured year after year.
5,Cleveland Cavaliers,-1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1,red,gold,"The Cavaliers may only have won one championship in their history, but that 2016 run was perhaps the single most captivating, Herculean, fairytale-esque championship ever won. By becoming a Cavs fan, you are also accepting LeBron James as your king, and signing up for a lifetime of defending him from Jordan fans in Instagram comment sections."
6,Dallas Mavericks,1,1,2,1,-1,-2,1,-1,blue,grey,"The Dallas Mavericks are essentially a European all-star team — which isn’t something you’d expect from a city known mostly for American football, barbecue, and rodeos. You better start learning Slovenian, because you’re gonna be saying the name Luka Doncic an awful lot."
7,Denver Nuggets,-1,-1,2,1,-2,-2,-1,-2,blue,yellow,"The Denver Nuggets are the current reigning NBA champions. It almost feels weird to say that given their overall unserious vibe — they wear rainbows on their jerseys, and their best player is some Serbian guy with a dad bod who wanted to be a horse jockey as a kid but his dreams were dashed when he grew up to be 7 feet tall. Oh yeah, and all those Jamal Murray memes you see on the internet — it’s better if you just don’t ask questions about those…"
8,Detroit Pistons,1,1,1,-1,1,2,2,1,blue,red,"The Pistons are one of the few teams that can say they beat Michael Jordan AND Kobe Bryant in the playoffs, and in both those cases they did it in the most Detroit way possible — by beating the [expletive] out of them. In recent years, it’s been a rough time to be a Pistons fan, but they’ll start racking up those wins as soon as they decide to start resorting to violence again."
9,Golden State Warriors,2,1,-2,2,-1,-2,-2,-2,yellow,blue,"The Warriors have been far and away the most dominant team in the NBA over the last decade. At one point, they were so much better than everyone else that it made basketball almost unwatchable for three whole years. Fans of every other team will hate you — but it’s okay, we’re all just jealous."
10,Houston Rockets,2,1,1,2,-1,-1,-1,1,red,black,"Outside of people who live in Houston, there are two types of Rockets fans. There are the Chinese fans who started supporting the team when they had Yao Ming and stuck with them ever since (the good kind). Then there are the finance and tech bros who watched the movie MONEYBALL and think the Rockets invented the concept that 3-pointers are worth more points than 2-pointers (the other kind). All jokes aside, you got a solid team here — congrats."
11,Indiana Pacers,-2,1,2,-2,-2,1,2,-1,yellow,blue,"The Pacers are the ultimate underdogs. They may not have won any championships, but the amount of playoff series they’ve managed to win while being completely outmatched on paper still makes them an exciting team to root for."
12,Los Angeles Clippers,-1,-2,-1,-1,2,1,-1,2,blue,red,"I can’t explain it, but there’s an overlap between Clippers fans and people who think cryptocurrency is gonna work. This team has had tremendous talent over the last decade, but every time it looks like it’s gonna be their year, something goes wrong. Then, when they’re supposed to be bad, they go and overachieve. There’s a level of unpredictability with the Clippers, and it could either be a blessing or a nightmare for your experience as a fan."
13,Los Angeles Lakers,2,2,-2,2,2,-2,-1,-2,yellow,purple,"To put it shortly, the Lakers are basketball royalty. More than any other team, they’ve got star-power — both playing in their uniforms and sitting courtside watching their games. At the end of the day, sports is entertainment, and the Lakers know how to put on a show."
14,Memphis Grizzlies,-2,-2,2,-2,2,2,1,-1,blue,yellow,"Despite being a relatively new addition to the league, the Memphis Grizzlies have quickly carved out an identity for themselves as an underdog team that works hard and is annoying to play against. You want a team with a chip on their shoulder, this is the team for you."
15,Miami Heat,2,-1,-1,2,-1,2,-1,-2,red,black,"The Heat have a strong team culture, hardworking players, and are arguably the most well-coached team in the league. But I don’t need to tell you that. Because Heat fans will — every single chance they get. Like, I’m sorry, if I have to see another post about how Jimmy Butler’s mentality is built different, I’m gonna lose my mind."
16,Milwaukee Bucks,-1,1,-1,1,-2,1,-1,-1,green,gold,"The best part of the Bucks 2021 championship run was the fact that  Giannis Antetokounmpo - less than 24 hours after scoring 50 points to secure the win in the final game of the series - pulled up to a drive-thru and ordered a 50-piece chicken nugget meal. If that doesn’t tell you he’s the most likable superstar in the NBA, then I don’t know what will."
17,Minnesota Timberwolves,-1,-2,2,-2,2,-1,1,2,blue,grey,"Just start over. You don’t want any part of this, trust me."
18,New Orleans Pelicans,-1,-2,2,-2,-1,-2,-1,1,gold,blue,"The Pelicans are the newest franchise in the NBA, and they’re loaded with young talent right now so it’s a great time to jump on board the hype train before it leaves the station. I mean, that’s what they were saying four years ago, so at this point it might not actually be going anywhere. This is definitely a team you’ll have to be patient with, but it could pay off big."
19,New York Knicks,2,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,blue,orange,"The Knicks have been an absolute mess over the last two decades, which is putting it lightly. They fail to make the playoffs more often than not, cycle through head coaches like they’re Conservative UK Prime Ministers, and enforce security measures in their stadium that border on human rights abuses. So why become a Knicks fan? Because now you’ll always have something to complain about — and that’s the full New York experience."
20,Oklahoma City Thunder,1,-2,-1,1,-2,-1,2,-1,blue,orange,"Honestly, the Thunder have never been bad since the franchise moved to Oklahoma City in 2008 — and for most of that time they’ve actually been a top-tier team. Thunder fans are probably the most consistently optimistic fanbase in the NBA, and you’ll have no reason not to be as well."
21,Orlando Magic,-1,-1,2,-1,-2,-2,-1,2,blue,grey,"The Magic have had their moments, being the only team to win a playoff series against Michael Jordan in the 90s as well as making the finals in 2009. Ever since then, it’s been a slow rebuild — but they’re getting there, and there’s certainly worse teams to be a fan of."
22,Philadelphia 76ers,2,2,-1,1,2,1,2,2,red,blue,"The Sixers are notorious in modern NBA history for losing games on purpose in multiple seasons to get better draft picks. This strategy landed them the number one overall pick in two consecutive drafts in 2016 and 2017 — which they used to select a player who refuses to shoot the ball when he’s left open, and a player who somehow forgot how to shoot altogether. But through good and bad, the overall energy and passion of 76ers fans still make this a fun team to root for."
23,Phoenix Suns,2,-1,-1,1,2,-2,-2,-1,orange,purple,"The Suns are loaded with talent right now, and what’s more impressive is the fact that their star players always have the time of day to get into arguments with random fans on Twitter. If you like all the excitement that comes with drama and dysfunction, but still want a good basketball team to watch when you cut through all that, this is the team for you."
24,Portland Trail Blazers,-1,-1,2,1,-2,1,1,1,red,black,"Somebody needs to investigate this team for suspicious insider betting activity, because the Blazers somehow only ever win when everyone expects them to lose. As a fan, expect a consistently above-average team year after year that can occasionally pull off an improbable run that gets everybody talking about them."
25,Sacramento Kings,-2,-1,2,-2,1,-2,1,2,purple,grey,"A tinfoil hat would be a more fitting logo for this team than a crown. Kings fans are the conspiracy theorists of the NBA —  and honestly, I don’t blame them. They haven’t been good since Y2K, their management has made trades even a toddler would know better than to make, and it’s since been confirmed that referees officiating a series they were playing in took out bets against them. So yeah, enjoy going down those rabbit holes."
26,San Antonio Spurs,1,2,-2,2,-2,2,-1,-2,grey,black,"The Spurs often get labeled the most boring team in the NBA. But honestly, that’s probably a good thing. There’s no drama, no rumors, and no distractions — just good, solid basketball. The only time they ever make headlines is when they're winning championships. Which they do a lot."
27,Toronto Raptors,1,-1,-1,2,-2,-1,1,-2,red,grey,"Honestly, the Raptors are just the total package. Likable players? Check. Cool mascot? Check. Unique city and fan culture? Check. Won a championship recently? Check. Plus, Drake writes songs about your team? You’ll have a great time being a fan."
28,Utah Jazz,-1,1,2,-2,-1,1,1,-1,purple,green,"You might be asking yourself: Why does a state full of people who think salt is spicy have a sports team called the Jazz? I can’t tell you the answer to that, but I can tell you that this is a consistently above-average basketball team that has even been elite at times — so maybe just don’t question it."
29,Washington Wizards,-1,1,2,-2,1,-1,1,2,red,blue,"Michael Jordan once played for this team — and let’s just say there’s a reason they don’t sell Jordan 1s in Wizards colors. This is not a team that’s going anywhere, and honestly I wouldn’t blame you if you just started over."
